## A minimalist moodboard ##
  > Gather one, gather all (images).

## Summary ##
  > For the person who needs to curate their Spring/Summer vs. Fall/Winter aestheti'que'. 
  > For the person upgrading their interior design to a Scandinavian post-modern architecture that doesn't scream "IKEA".
  > But mainly for the person trying to draw inspiration from a bunch of images mish-mashed together in a semi-random, pleasing manner.

## Problem ##
  > Pinterest is painfully clunky - and between friends planning their future wedding, ridiculously obvious life 'hacks', and various recipes that require thirty ingredients and five hours to make, you realize it's probably not the platform for you. 
  > Photoshop and Sketch are expensive, and you don't feel like saving a photo just to upload it onto a Powerpoint slide and then deleting it from your hard drive.

## Solution ##
  > Moodboard.io is a simple, bare-bones moodboard generator that grabs any image URL you feed it and renders it on a blank page, until your page is filled with only images that you've carefully curated.
